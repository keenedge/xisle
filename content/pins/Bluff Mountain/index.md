## Intro

Hike through Camp Barnard and follow the Bluff Mountain Trail.  When in use Camp Barnard discourages randos walking through.  You can use the road to the south and cut in to the trail around here (48°24'36"N 123°45'14"W).  [The trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore?b_tl_lat=48.41333895308898&b_tl_lng=-123.76085178464982&b_br_lat=48.408072908059154&b_br_lng=-123.74660435739082&cc=true&a[]=hiking) is shown on AllTrails.
