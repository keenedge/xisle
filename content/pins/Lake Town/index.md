## Intro

A very large fairground.  The owner is very welcoming but wants a heads up when we plan to use it.  One of the Pilots landed there and got this message:

`
The owner of Laketown Ranch, asked that we text him on days when we might land there. (250)-715-7978 - He has no issue with us landing, just wants notice, in case thereâ€™s a helicopter or event using the fairgrounds.
