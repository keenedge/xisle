## Notes for Editors

* The site is generated with Hugo.

* Served from Github pages.

* The Theme is "Blowfish"

* Built with a github action when you push to main.

* Editable Content is in the "Content Folder and sub folders."

* If the layout doesn't work for you let's talk before you tweek the layout files.

* I'm editing directly in main.  Should probaly start merging pull requests but I'm reall just intersted in keeping it low mainteace.
